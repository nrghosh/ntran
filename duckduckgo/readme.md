## DuckDB transaction benchmarking


Super simple MVP for benchmarking performance of DuckDB when attempting to reconcile state from simple/complex queries done by several agents at once 


### TODO
- add more data to duckDB on start
- more complex queries
- consensus logic 
- track granular (i.e CPU i/o, memory, etc) stats for benchmarking
